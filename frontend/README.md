# Crypto Coin Visualization Tool

A modern and interactive web application for visualizing cryptocurrency coins as draggable bubbles on a canvas. Users can search for coins, view detailed information, and interact with the bubbles.

## Features

- **Search for Coins**: Enter a coin name or symbol to fetch data and add it to the canvas.
- **Interactive Bubbles**: Drag and drop bubbles to reposition them.
- **Dynamic Bubble Size**: Bubbles grow in size based on search frequency.
- **Coin Details**: Click on a bubble to view detailed information and a price history chart.
- **Modern UI**: Glassy, transparent bubbles with smooth animations.

## TODO

### Frontend
- [ ] Fix bubble drag-and-drop constraints to prevent bubbles from disappearing.
- [ ] Add error handling for API requests (e.g., display error messages to the user).
- [ ] Improve the search bar UI (e.g., add a loading spinner while fetching data).
- [ ] Add a reset button to clear the canvas.
- [ ] Implement a feature to save and load bubble positions (e.g., using local storage).
- [ ] Add a dark mode/light mode toggle.

### Backend
- [ ] Add rate limiting to the backend API to prevent abuse.
- [ ] Cache API responses to improve performance.
- [ ] Add support for more cryptocurrency APIs (e.g., CoinMarketCap, Binance).

### Styling
- [ ] Improve the modal design (e.g., add animations, better spacing).
- [ ] Add hover effects to bubbles (e.g., glow or scale on hover).
- [ ] Make the canvas background more visually appealing (e.g., gradient or pattern).

### Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for frontend components.
- [ ] Write integration tests for the backend API.
- [ ] Test the application on different screen sizes and browsers.

### Documentation
- [ ] Add a detailed setup guide to the `README.md`.
- [ ] Document the API endpoints and their responses.
- [ ] Add screenshots or a demo video to the `README.md`.

### Deployment
- [ ] Deploy the frontend to a hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
- [ ] Deploy the backend to a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
